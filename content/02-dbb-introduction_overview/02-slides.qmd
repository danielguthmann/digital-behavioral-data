Below you  find the slides for the second session:

<div>

```{=html}
<iframe class="slide-deck" src="slides/" width = "800" height = "450"></iframe>
```

</div>

If you want to see the slides in full screen, you can click [here](slides/){target="_blank"}. To download them as PDFs, hit the 'e' button when you got the presentation open and then Ctrl+P print to PDF. This will work best in Chrome.
